**Week 1 - Submission** <br><br>
This is a simple implementation of the WCC info bot following the templates provided in the AI Learning series. 

**How to run it**

Required:
- API key set up in .env (root): GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
- Install: 
    - google-generativeai
    - python-dotenv
    - streamlit

To run on Streamlit (from current folder): 
```python
streamlit run app.py
```

**What I learned** 

- set up of a chat bot 
- setting the personality of the chat bot 
- use of streamlit 

**Challenges faced**

- first project so set up required, although getting the API key was a simple process
- run from current folder to avoid errors with streamlit 

**Future improvements**

- confirm how scraper.py is incorporated
